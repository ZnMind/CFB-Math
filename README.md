## CFB Math

With all the recent controversy surrounding the college football playoffs, I thought it might be fun to crunch my own numbers just to see what results I get.

I added several popular rating systems such as Elo and SoV, as well as attempting to implement the Bradley-Terry model. The results were interesting to say the least!

The [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZNrG9KXu2seOHq_aFIenB4l1lQAf3DTsaAKWERIA9pU/edit?usp=sharing) I created using Google Sheets API lists every game played and resulting Elo calculations, as well as some other fun stuff! The rest of the numbers and models are in the [json](/json) folder.
